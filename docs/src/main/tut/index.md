# Finatra Integrations

_Finatra Integrations_ is a guideline for the common practice of finatra `2.11` integrations with `grafter`, `docker-it-scala`, and the `Pipe` operators. The hamster `FutureEither` monad transformer will also be used in examples.

The code base is from this g8 porject - [https://github.com/forthy/finatra.g8](https://github.com/forthy/finatra.g8)
